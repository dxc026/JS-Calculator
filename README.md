# JS Calculator

### Summary
For this project I created a basic calculator. All the HTML was created dynamically using JavaScript and the functionality is also made in Java Script as well. The user can add, subtract, divide, and multiply two numbers. The clear button works as well as the = button will bring back the sum, difference, quotient and product of the two numbers based on the operator button selected.

### Disclaimer
All the JavaSCript files are attached and run through the "home.html" instead of the "index.html" because the tests wanted the table to be created through HTML and not dynamically. Upon making the HTML dynamically none of the tests were working.

### How to Users
To use the calculator, the user has to click the individual buttons. The display field will display what it clicked.

### Trials and Tribulations
What I struggled most with this project is the actual functionality and getting the numbers to display in the field.

### Goals for the Future
I have the ability to use the actual keys but the functionality wasn't working, so I want to get that to work in the future.
Next, I want to learn how to style dynamically created HTML. I would add borders and colors as well as fix the over all spacing.
